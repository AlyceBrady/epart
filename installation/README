EPART: Epidemic Patient and Resource Tracking
    Built on top of RAMP - Record and Activity Management Program

This directory contains instructions and sample files to help you create
an Apache virtual host and to set up one or more databases to use
with the Epart Prototype.

The installDB directory contains a number of files that:
  -- Create appropriate MySQL accounts (if they don't exist already).
  -- Create basic tables used by the underlying RAMP framework for
     such things as authentication, authorization, and record locking.
  -- Create prototype Epart tables.

You may use these files as guides for creating accounts interactively
in MySQL, or you may edit them and then use them as scripts within MySQL:
     mysql> SOURCE filename.sql

    SECURITY CONCERNS:
    Please read the installation instructions in INSTALL_DB.txt,
    particularly the section on "Addressing Security Concerns,"
    BEFORE using these files as guides or using them as scripts.
    AT THE VERY LEAST, use different passwords than are specified
    in the files that create MySQL accounts.  If you put new passwords
    in a file to read as a script, change the permissions on the
    file before-hand, to be readable only by the owner.

## Creating an Apache virtual host ##

The epart.conf file contains a sample VirtualHost definition
for a virtual host named epart.nu.edu.sl.  Edit that file to give it
the name you want, making sure that the DocumentRoot is also set
correctly.  How you turn on a virtual host depends on your operating
system; for example, on a Debian or Ubuntu server, you would do the
following (using sudo for all three steps):

    Copy epart.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available.
    Enable the site:  a2ensite epart.
    Restart the apache server (e.g., service apache2 reload).

On some other systems, such as MacOS, you would copy the virtual host
definition from epart.conf into a system-wide virtual host
configuration file (e.g., /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf).

## Creating Epart Environment databases ##

The rest of this file contains instructions for creating an Epart Demo
or development environment (a sample environment whose data you can
view and change).


### CREATING A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:  (epart_demo database) ###

createEPARTMysqlAccts.sql
    Working with Epart requires two types of Mysql Accounts:  database
    administrator accounts (one for each DBA) and a single account that is
    used by the web-based EPART software.  The createEPARTMysqlAccts.sql
    file has commands that create both and grant them appropriate
    permissions on the epart_demo database.  If you already have
    appropriate database administrator accounts (or an existing account
    for Epart to use), you can comment out the appropriate commands.
    In that case, make sure you edit the GRANT commands to use your
    existing accounts.

    You must run MySQL as root (or some other user that has CREATE USER
    and GRANT permissions to execute the commands found in this file.

    ==> Instructions:
        Copy createEPARTMysqlAccts.sql to a file readable only to you
            (e.g., copy it to createMysqlAccts.sql and change the
            permissions of that file).
        Edit the file to create appropriate account names and passwords,
            or comment out the CREATE USER commands if you have existing
            accounts.  In either case, update the GRANT commands to
            refer to the appropriate account names.
        Run MySQL as root to execute the commands, e.g.,
            mysql> SOURCE createMysqlAccts.sql

installDB/setupEpartDB.sql
    This file calls most of the other files in the installDB directory.
    They clear out the contents of the epart_demo database (if a previous
    version existed), and create appropriate tables.

    ==> Instructions:
        Change to the installDB directory (e.g., cd installDB).
        Run MySQL as root or as a DBA and run the setupEpartDB.sql
        script:
            mysql> SOURCE setupEpartDB.sql

In order for EPART to use the MySQL account you have set up for it and
access the database, you will need to specify the account username,
password, and database in an application.ini file in the configs
directory.

==> See the README file in the configs directory for more information.
